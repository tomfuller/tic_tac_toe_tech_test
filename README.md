## Tic tac toe Tech Test

#### What is it?
  Functional business logic for a game of tic tac toe.

#### How does it work?
  Unfortunately as the brief only specified the business logic and I only had a day to write it I used the time to make the code as clean as I possibly could.

#### My approach
  While writing this tech test I was very aware that it was more of a test of my ability to produce clean, testable and reusable code than it was a sprint to finish and git it an interface. With this in mind I followed the SOLID principles to the best of my ability and was constantly checking for signs of underlying design problems.

#### The brief

The rules of tic-tac-toe are as follows:

1. There are two players in the game (X and O)
2. Players take turns until the game is over
3. A player can claim a field if it is not already taken
4. A turn ends when a player claims a field
5. A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
6. A game is over if a player wins
7. A game is over when all fields are taken
8. Build the business logic for a game of tic tac toe. It should be easy to implement a working game of tic tac toe by combining your code with any user interface, whether web or command line.
